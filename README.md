khud
====

khud is a unique graphical mod to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.

Building on the current GUI and HUD developed by Vavle and Hidden Path Entertainment - instead of launching the game through Steam, the player opens a shortcut (Desktop/Start Menu/Quick Launch) which automatically checks for updates to the HUD and installs silently.

Design inspiration comes from games such as Assasins Creed, Watch Dogs and designers like GMUNK. It follows the path of many futureistic ui (thin lines, grids, white/black/red).
